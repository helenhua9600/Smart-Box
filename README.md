   ## Design and Implementation Details
   We used a UBC ECE's virtual machine to keypad to host our web services and as a connection to the IOT. For hardware, we used 1 Motion Detection Sensor (PIR) to detect when the object has been caught in the box, 4 stepper motors to move the box, 2 sonar sensors to help calculate where the box is on the playing field and a Raspberry Pi Pico W to connect to the internet and backend of the project.
